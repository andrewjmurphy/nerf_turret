# Remote controlled Nerf Turret

This is the arduino control code for my remote control nerf turret.
It uses an arduino Uno with a 36 kHz infrared receiver to take input from
a generic NEC protocol remote control (salvaged from an old digital TV
tuner set-top-box) and turn that into control signals for a selection of
relays. These relays are in turn connected to electric screwdriver motors
as well as the control board for a nerf elite rapidstrike CS-18.
